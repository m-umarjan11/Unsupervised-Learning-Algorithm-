## Introduction

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data. The goal is to infer the natural structure present within a set of data points. Common unsupervised learning algorithms include:
- **KMeans Clustering**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
- **DBSCAN**

### KMeans Clustering
KMeans is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into K clusters. It assigns data points to clusters in such a way that the sum of the squared distances between the data points and the cluster centroids is minimized.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unsupervised-learning.git
    cd unsupervised-learning
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Example: KMeans Clustering

Below is an example of how to use the KMeans Clustering algorithm to solve a clustering problem.

1. Load your dataset.
2. Preprocess the data.
3. Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
4. Train the KMeans model.
5. Visualize the clusters.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from kneed import KneeLocator
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
X, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=4, cluster_std=0.60, random_state=0)

# Elbow method to find optimal number of clusters
wcss = []
for i in range(1, 11):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=i, init='k-means++', random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(X)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)

kneedle = KneeLocator(range(1, 11), wcss, curve='convex', direction='decreasing')

# Plot the elbow graph
plt.plot(range(1, 11), wcss, marker='o')
plt.vlines(kneedle.elbow, plt.ylim()[0], plt.ylim()[1], linestyles='dashed', colors='red')
plt.title('The Elbow Method')
plt.xlabel('Number of clusters')
plt.ylabel('WCSS')
plt.show()

print(f'The optimal number of clusters is: {kneedle.elbow}')

# Train the model with optimal number of clusters
optimal_clusters = kneedle.elbow
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=optimal_clusters, init='k-means++', random_state=42)
y_kmeans = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

# Visualize the clusters
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y_kmeans, s=50, cmap='viridis')
centers = kmeans.cluster_centers_
plt.scatter(centers[:, 0], centers[:, 1], c='red', s=200, alpha=0.75, marker='X')
plt.title(f'KMeans Clustering with {optimal_clusters} Clusters')
plt.show()
